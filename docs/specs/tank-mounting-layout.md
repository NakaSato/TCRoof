# Auto mounting layout from the tank (ผังโครงสร้างแผงบนหลังคาถัง)

**Status:** Draft for development, 2026-09-29
**Builds on:** tank drawing ([`tank-drawing-swift.md`](tank-drawing-swift.md), [`tank-interaction-dev.md`](tank-interaction-dev.md)),
types in [`auto-drawing-swift.md`](auto-drawing-swift.md) §8
**Interaction dev spec:** [`mount-interaction-dev.md`](mount-interaction-dev.md) · **Interactive prototype:** `prototype/mount-layout.html` · **Prototype:** `img/tank_mount.py` (run from `img/`) → `tank_mount_plan.png`, `tank_mount_section.png`, `tank_mount_front.png`
**Reference sheets (team standard):** `img/ref_mount_section.png`, `img/ref_mount_front.png`, `img/ref_mount_plan.png`

The surveyor already enters the tank (bays, vents, hatches, ladders). This feature places the PV mounting structure
on that roof automatically, using the team's tank-roof structure standard: rows of tables, posts, footings,
rails and clamps, avoiding openings. It then draws the plan, the side section and the front elevation, and counts the
materials. The surveyor enters nothing new except, where needed, the vent height and the plan's north.

## 1. The structure standard (one set, editable in settings)

Taken from the reference sheets. Every value is printed under the drawing as มาตรฐาน / ค่าสมมติ.

| Key | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `moduleL × moduleW` | 2.28 × 1.13 m, 600 W | module, portrait along the slope |
| `nSlope` | 2 | modules along the slope (slope length 4.58 m with a 0.02 m gap) |
| `hFront`, `hBack` | 1.00, 2.00 m | top of front / back post above the roof |
| `postDY` | 2.80 m | front post → back post (plan) ⇒ tilt = atan(1.00 / 2.80) = **19.7°** |
| `rowGap` | 2.70 m | back post of a row → front post of the next ⇒ row pitch **5.50 m** |
| `postDX` | ≤ 2.70 m | post spacing along the row (equal spacing per table) |
| `endOver` | 0.40 m | rail overhang past the end posts |
| `frontOver` | 0.46 m (slope) | front post → lower panel edge; the back overhang follows (1.15 m) |
| `rails` | 4 per table | rail clamps where each rail crosses a rafter |
| `footing` | 300 × 300 × 150 mm concrete, anchored to the slab | one per post |
| `edge`, `openClear` | 1.0 m, 0.5 m | same setbacks as the usable-area rule |
| `ventH`, `underClear` | 1.00 m, 0.10 m | vent height above the roof (0.40 + 0.60 on the sheet), clearance under the panels |
| `bracing` | X in every post bay, front and back lines | |

Derived: table plan depth = 4.58 × cos 19.7° = **4.31 m**; panel underside height at plan distance d north of the
front post = 1.00 + d · tan 19.7°.

## 2. Inputs

| Input | Source | New? |
|---|---|---|
| tank outline, bays | D1 `spansX`, `spansY` | no |
| vents, hatches, ladders, pipes | D1 `obst` (typed) | no |
| north of the tank plan | D1 `planNorth` (ด้านบน / ขวา / ล่าง / ซ้าย), default ด้านบน | **yes**, one choice describing the site |
| vent height | D1 `ventHeight` (ม.), default 1.00 (ค่าสมมติ) | **yes**, optional measurement |
| structure standard | settings (§1) | settings only |

Panels face the equator (south); rows run east–west. With north not at the top, the layout is computed in a rotated
frame and drawn back in the tank's frame.

## 3. Layout algorithm

All in metres, tank frame rotated so south is +y.

1. **Region:** roof inset by `edge`.
2. **Columns:** `n = ⌊(W − 2·edge + gap) / (moduleW + gap)⌋`, centred across the tank. Every row uses the same columns,
   so tables line up north–south.
3. **Rows** from the south edge: row k has its lower panel edge at `TH − edge − k·5.50`, front posts 0.43 m north of it,
   back posts 2.80 m further, upper panel edge 1.08 m beyond. Stop when the upper edge passes the north setback.
4. **Openings per row** (each opening grown by `openClear`):
   - **hatch** overlapping the row → the module columns over it are removed (keep access).
   - **vent** overlapping the row → if the lowest panel point above it is at least `ventH + underClear`, the vent stays
     under the panels (counted as "อยู่ใต้แผงได้"); otherwise the columns over it are removed.
   - pipes and ladders are outside the roof and do not block.
5. **Tables:** each run of at least 2 free columns is one table.
6. **Posts — legs never touch an obstacle (hard rule).** Every footing must be inside the tank and at least 0.30 m
   clear of every opening (vent, hatch). Front and back posts share a rafter, so they are placed **as a pair**.
   Per table: try the standard equal spacing (`nPost = ⌈(length − 2·endOver) / postDX⌉ + 1`); if any pair is not
   free, place the pairs greedily from the west end on a 0.05 m grid — first pair within 1.00 m of the table end
   (`maxCantilever`), each next pair at most `postDX` further and at least 0.60 m away, last pair within 1.00 m of the
   east end. If no free spot exists, the **module column where it fails is removed** (the table is shortened or split)
   and the parts are posted again. Removed columns are drawn as red outlines with the reason
   "ตัดแผงเพื่อไม่ให้ขาโครงสร้างชนสิ่งกีดขวาง". There are no flagged posts: every drawn leg is clear.
7. **Quantities** (per table, summed): modules, kWp, posts = footings, rafters, rail length (4 × table length),
   rail clamps (rails × rafters), mid clamps (2 per module joint per module row), end clamps (2 per end per module row),
   X braces (2 per bay), ground lugs (1 per table).

Prototype result on the กปภ. 40 × 40 tank (first version, before the no-collision rule): 7 rows, 13 tables, 394 modules,
236.4 kWp; 8 vents stay under the panels. With the rule, the columns next to the corner vents are cut instead of flagged
(see §3a for the final numbers).


## 3a. Accurate layout: panels face south, best energy per year

The first version filled the roof with as many modules as fit, rows parallel to the tank walls. The accurate version
(`img/tank_mount_opt.py`) makes the panels face **true south** and chooses the layout by **annual energy**, because the
tank is rarely square to the compass and closer rows shade each other.

**Two more site inputs (measurements, not design choices):**

| Field | Source | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `tankBearing` — the direction the plan's top wall faces, ° from true north | compass on site (the iPhone/iPad compass can fill it) | 0° (= `planNorth` ด้านบน) |
| latitude | the survey GPS (`gps`, A1) | — (required for the energy model) |

`planNorth` (4 directions) stays as a quick fallback; the bearing replaces it when entered.

**Method**

1. **Orientation — the team rule: rows follow the tank (ขนานผนังถัง).** Panels face the wall side nearest to south;
   the panel azimuth is the bearing's offset (≤ 45°) and is used in the energy model. True-south rows are still computed
   for the comparison chart only:
   - **หันทิศใต้จริง** — rows run exactly east–west (panel azimuth 0°). The tank, its setbacks and openings are rotated
     into that frame, so tables sit at an angle to the walls.
   - **ขนานผนังถัง** — rows parallel to the wall that faces closest to south; panel azimuth = the bearing's offset
     (≤ 45°).
2. **Geometry in any rotation:** module slots, footings and grown openings are polygons; a slot is valid when all its
   corners are inside the inset tank and it does not intersect a grown hatch or a too-low vent (separating axis test);
   footings must be inside the tank and 0.30 m clear of every opening; posts follow §3 step 6 (no leg on an obstacle,
   cut a column when needed).
3. **Sun model, whole year, 15-minute steps (every 3rd day):** NOAA-style sun position from latitude, clear-sky GHI
   (Haurwitz) scaled by 0.72 for Thai haze and clouds, Erbs diffuse split, isotropic sky, albedo 0.20, PR 0.80. It gives
   about 1,450–1,480 kWh/kWp·yr at 17° N, in line with Thai PV yields; the absolute value is ประมาณ, the comparison is what
   matters.
4. **Row-to-row shading** in the rows' own plane: profile angle `tan αp = tan α / cos(γs − γp)`, shaded share of the
   next row's slope `f = 1 − (pitch / slope) · sin αp / sin(αp + β)`. **Portrait-2 electrical rule:** a shadow over the
   bottom 4 % of the slope drops the whole bottom module's beam (its three bypass substrings all lose their bottom cells);
   past 54 % the top module goes too. The south-most row is unshaded.
5. **Search:** row gap from the standard 2.70 m up to 4.70 m (0.20 m steps) × row offset (0.20 m) × column offset
   (0.10 m). Stage 1 counts modules without posts (fast); stage 2 re-runs the ten best with post placement, because a
   cut column can change the order. For each gap the layout with the most modules is kept; then the gap with the highest
   **MWh/yr** wins. Row gaps below the standard are never tried (maintenance access and bracing). About 16 s in Python
   for both orientations; well under a second in Swift.

**Result, กปภ. 40 × 40 tank, 17.0° N, top wall facing 12°:**

| Orientation | Row gap | Modules | kWp | kWh/kWp·yr | Row shading | MWh/yr |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ขนานผนังถัง (azimuth +12°)** | 2.70 | 404 | 242.4 | 1,452 | 1.9 % | **352.0** ← chosen (6 columns cut so no leg touches a vent) |
| ขนานผนังถัง | 3.10 | 370 | 222.0 | 1,467 | 0.8 % | 325.9 |
| หันทิศใต้จริง (comparison only) | 2.70 | 368 | 220.8 | 1,455 | 1.8 % | 321.3 |
| หันทิศใต้จริง (comparison only) | 3.50 | 330 | 198.0 | 1,475 | 0.3 % | 292.1 |

Legs on obstacles in the chosen layout: **0** (198 posts, all footings ≥ 0.30 m from every opening).

What this says:

- Turning the rows 12° to face true south gains only about 0.2 % per kWp but loses 48 modules to the rotated fit, so the
  wall-parallel layout makes about **10 % more energy** — which supports the team's rule to follow the tank.
- The team's 2.70 m row gap costs about 1.9 % to shading at 17° N; wider gaps shade less but remove whole rows. The
  standard gap is the best choice for this tank.

| Chosen (follow the tank, best energy) | True south (comparison only) | Energy by row gap |
|---|---|---|

UI (adds to [`mount-interaction-dev.md`](mount-interaction-dev.md)): rows always follow the tank; the bearing field with
a **วัดด้วยเข็มทิศ** button (CoreLocation heading, true north, the device held along the top wall) sets the panel azimuth
for the energy numbers; energy tiles (MWh/yr, kWh/kWp, row shading %) sit next to the module count, and
"หาผังที่ได้แผงมากที่สุด" becomes **หาผังที่ได้พลังงานมากที่สุด**.

Swift: `TCRoofCore/Mounting/SunModel.swift` (sun position, clear-sky, POA, row shading; pure functions, unit-tested
against the Python numbers above), `MountLayout` gains `orientation`, polygon geometry (`Polygon.sat`, `contains`), and
`MountOptimizer` runs the search off the main thread.

Performance: the 40 × 40 layout is a few hundred boxes; compute with the tank geometry off the main thread.

Tests: the §3 numbers for the 40 × 40 fixture; a hatch removes exactly the columns it covers; a vent under the
back half stays, one under the front edge removes columns; post pairs never sit on an opening; bay spacing never
exceeds `postDX` unless flagged; snapshot SVGs of the three sheets.

## 6. Open questions

1. Accept the energy model assumptions (clear-sky × 0.72, PR 0.80, portrait-2 shading rule) or supply a measured TMY / PVsyst yield to calibrate?

2. Must posts land on the tank's columns or beams (4.00 m grid) rather than anywhere on the slab? If so, the post
   spacing along the row should snap to the bay grid instead of ≤ 2.70 m.
3. Is the row gap (2.70 m) fixed, or should it follow a shading rule (e.g. no shade at 9:00–15:00 on 21 December)?
4. Walkways: does the team need a maintenance path to every hatch and between tables (width?), beyond the 0.5 m clearance?
5. Vent heights: one value per tank, or per vent (box vents vs mushroom vents)?
6. Grounding: one lug per table as drawn, plus ground plates at the tank edge (detail H) — how many and where?
